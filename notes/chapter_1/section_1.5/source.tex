\section{Cantor's Theorem}
    \subsection*{Cantor's Diagonalization Method}
        Cantor initially published his discovery that \textbf{R} is uncountable in 1874, but in 1891 he offered another simpler proof that relies on decimal representations for real numbers.
        \begin{theorem}
            The open interval $(0, 1) = \{x \in \textbf{R}: 0 < x < 1\}$ is uncountable.
        \end{theorem}
